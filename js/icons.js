/*
    Simple Icons JS for minimal dependency
    Normally would use react-icons or similar but keeping vanilla for MVP
*/

// Handled via CSS background-image or simple SVG imports if needed
// For now, HTML structure uses class names like "icon home" which are styled in CSS
// This file is a placeholder if complex icon logic is needed later.
